                <p>
                  Prime Gene Biomedical Solutions grants to Buyer the warranty
                  last published by Prime Gene Biomedical Solutions before the
                  time of shipment of the goods. Prime Gene Biomedical Solutions
                  MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES TO BUYER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND
                  HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
                  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Complaints shall be made in writing to Prime Gene Biomedical
                  Solutions. With regard to incomplete or incorrect deliveries,
                  complaints shall be notified and claimed without undue delay
                  after delivery and, with regard to notice of defects,
                  complaints shall be made without undue delay after
                  determination of the defect but, at the latest, however, 3
                  days after delivery. Claims of defects of the ordering party
                  shall exist in principle only if the ordering party has
                  properly performed the afore-mentioned examination and
                  objection obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The warranty period corresponds to the expiry date imprinted
                  on the packages, however to a maximum of 12 months after
                  supply. For instruments, spare parts, and pipettes for 12
                  months after date of invoice if no other periods have been
                  earlier agreed. The warranty period excludes disposables and
                  parts subject to wear & tear. If spare parts are installed or
                  repairs carried out inexpertly, no warranty regress can be
                  claimed. Additionally, the instrument warranty will expire
                  immediately if the maintenance procedures detailed in the
                  service manual of the instrument are not carried out as
                  indicated in the intervals prescribed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Insofar as a defect of the goods exists for which Prime Gene
                  Biomedical Solutions is responsible, Prime Gene Biomedical
                  Solutions shall be obliged, to the exclusion of the ordering
                  party&rsquo;s right to cancel the contract or to reduce the
                  purchase price (reduction), to subsequent performance in order
                  to remedy the defect, unless Prime Gene Biomedical Solutions
                  is entitled to refuse subsequent performance pursuant to the
                  statutory provisions. The ordering party shall grant Prime
                  Gene Biomedical Solutions a reasonable time period within
                  which to undertake subsequent performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subsequent performance can, at the choice of Prime Gene
                  Biomedical Solutions, be undertaken in the form of elimination
                  of the defect (cure) or delivery of new goods. In the case of
                  elimination of the defect (cure), Prime Gene Biomedical
                  Solutions shall bear the necessary costs, insofar as these are
                  not increased because the subject matter of the contract is
                  located at a site other than the place of performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the subsequent performance is unsuccessful, the ordering
                  party can, at 1st choice, demand reduction of the purchase
                  price (reduction) or declare cancellation of the contract. The
                  elimination of the defect (cure) shall be deemed to be
                  unsuccessful upon the second unsuccessful attempt, insofar as,
                  due to the subject matter of the contract, additional
                  elimination of the defect (cure) attempts would not be
                  reasonable and appropriate for the ordering party.
